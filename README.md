Portuguese Palavras is a mobile first web application designed to make learning Portuguese as painless and quick as possible. Using a spaced repitition algorithm, the app only shows you words you don't already know. The app also can store user information so the user can continue to progress in his or her language studies.

This app was created by Peter Ramos and Nick (Nicholas) Justin.
